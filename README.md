# hello-world2
this is how I start working on homebrew then.

So a bit about myself. I'm starting to work on switchbrew and I started this github account to do that. I want to basically learn how to program, debug, analyze the kernel and optimize code from this project.

I've decided to port or develop a dreamcast emu for RetroNX. Lakka already has one, albeit at non-full speeds, but RetroNX has none, with the most intensive emu on there being a PSX emu. Seeing as RetroNX has a lower overhead (in theory) than lakka and it is homebrew while lakka is a distro, I decided developing for RetroNX would futureproof my emu and be more convient to an end-user.
